title: "LGCP on General Metric Graphs"
---

This website is a companion to the paper **“Log-Gaussian Cox Processes on General Metric Graphs”** by David Bolin, Damilya Saduakhas, and Alexandre B. Simas. The paper is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18558), and all code is provided in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/d-saduakhas/GraphLGCP).

### **Overview**
This website provides code and extended examples to **reproduce the traffic accident analysis** from the paper. While raw data cannot be shared, the methodology is demonstrated comprehensively.

### **Key Goals**
1. **Reproduce Results**: Step-by-step code for fitting LGCPs to traffic accident data.
2. **Methodology Guide**: Adapt the framework to similar problems (covariates, graph construction).
3. **Reproducibility**: Templates for inference, and visualization.

### **Navigation Guide**
Use the navbar above to explore the workflow:

- [Graph Setup](graph_setup.html): Build metric graphs from road networks.
- [Covariates](covariates.html): Prepare traffic/road covariates (speed limits, road type).
- [LGCP Models](model1.html): Fit Model 1 (spatial effects) and Model 2 (spatial + covariates).
- [Risk Analysis](exceedance.html): Compute exceedance probabilities for high-risk roads.
- [Interactive Maps](maps.html): Visualize results spatially.
